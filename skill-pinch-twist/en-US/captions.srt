Hello!

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,220
Another basic technique that should not be neglected...

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,880
is making "Pinch-Twists", 

4
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,080
or what I like to call "beans"!

5
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,640
So look carefully...

6
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:24,620
You start with two bubbles in a row,

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,840
the second one nice and round if you can manage.

8
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,200
At the start, I place a finger in the middle,

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,000
to pull the bubble back,

10
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,880
so it doesn't impede the pinching movement...

11
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,320
we're doing on both ends of the bubble.

12
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:41,850
This allows me to block everything together very easily.

13
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,310
There!

14
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:47,880
Well, you can still do this without pulling with your finger.

15
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,620
For example, here, I'm pinching... I'm twisting...

16
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,450
Well, sure... it still works.

17
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:55,870
But it creates a needless friction on the balloon

18
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,730
And with it... a bigger chance of the bubble bursting!

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,160
No... the best is:

20
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,080
One bubble... two bubbles... pull a little...

21
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,580
pinch right in the middle... and twist!

22
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,960
One bubble... two bubbles... pull a little...

23
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,900
pinch right in the middle... and twist!

24
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,760
Go on! Practice making at least a dozen of these in a row.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,680
One bubble... two bubbles... pull a little...

26
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:25,209
pinch right in the middle... and twist!

27
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,540
One bubble... two bubbles... pull a little...

28
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,700
pinch right in the middle... and twist!

29
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,660
And so on, and so forth!

30
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:38,400
So do practice this technique.

31
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,980
"Pinch-twists"... can be found in the tiger's ears,

32
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,340
and in many other creations.

33
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,980
So... see you soon!

34
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,920
For some new lessons with...

35
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:50,380
MÃ´ssieur Ballon !
