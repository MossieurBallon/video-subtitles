Hello!

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,560
How about learning to make a giraffe?

3
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,099
You need to inflate a balloon, yellow preferably,

4
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:17,080
leaving a margin about 5 fingers wide,

5
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:19,360
or alternately, a good hand's width.

6
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:21,500
Then make a knot and make sure to push it

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,070
all the way to the tip of the balloon so you don't lose any length.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,140
Angle the balloon at about 3 fingers away from the knot,

9
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:33,860
then make a bubble just under the fold.

10
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:37,370
Which allows us to move the bubble twist slightly off center

11
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:42,460
and hence get the effect of a forehead on the giraffe's head.

12
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,260
To make the horns, next we'll create a series of 4 bubbles

13
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:51,040
The first bubble will need to be nice and round,

14
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:54,720
and the second one will need to be smaller than the first.

15
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,750
Next, the third one will need to be exactly identical to the second one,

16
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,090
while the fourth and last bubble will need to be the same as the first.

17
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:05,290
Like this!

18
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:11,400
Hold the series of bubbles in place by twisting them around their base.

19
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:18,140
And next, make a little bubble which we'll use to make a pinch-twist

20
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:25,140
to consolidate and stiffen somewhat the head, horns, and neck.

21
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:36,840
If need be, push the air towards the reserve a little.

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:38,909
Next, for the giraffe's neck,

23
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:42,040
we'll use about the third of the remaining segment of the balloon

24
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,720
which can be easily figured out like this.

25
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:51,180
Fold the balloon at the mark to make a right angle,

26
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:55,310
This slight deformation of the bubble will now enable us to

27
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:59,170
more easily direct the neck towards the top of the giraffe.

28
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,000
To make the front legs, roughly evaluate

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,340
a quarter of the remaining portion of balloon

30
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:07,590
to form the bubble of the first leg,

31
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:10,940
which will be followed by a second bubble of equal size.

32
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:15,970
Block them together firmly, and make a pinch-twist right after,

33
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:20,610
which will enable us to adequately consolidate the neck from to the rest of the body.

34
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:25,380
Push the rest of the air to the tip of the remaining portion of balloon

35
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:30,319
which we'll divide into two unequal parts,

36
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,040
the last part should be a little shorter than the first.

37
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:38,560
Place these two segments side by side and twist them together,

38
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,510
almost at the tip of the shortest segment,

39
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:44,150
so as to form in a single motion,

40
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:48,660
the two hind legs, the abdomen and the tail of our giraffe.

41
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:52,629
The hind legs of the giraffe should be made shorter than the front legs

42
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:55,459
and its back should slope back downwards.

43
00:02:55,459 --> 00:03:01,530
If the angle we've made at the base of the neck has distended somewhat,

44
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:05,849
it will need to be reshaped so that the neck goes upwards,

45
00:03:05,849 --> 00:03:08,170
following the direction of the front legs.

46
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:13,620
Also make sure that the head and horns are correctly positioned

47
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:14,750
and there!

48
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,100
All we have left to do now is to draw the giraffe's features,

49
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,250
and a few spots.

50
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:29,440
But no need to go overboard, just a few are enough!

51
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:37,129
In fact, as a general rule, when drawing,

52
00:03:37,129 --> 00:03:40,089
it's better to do less... but better!

53
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,631
And there! That's all there is to it! 

54
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:51,280
So... See you soon!

55
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,680
For another lesson... with Mossieur Ballon!
