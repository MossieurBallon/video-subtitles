00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,930
Hi!

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:09,699
In this tutorial,

3
00:00:09,699 --> 00:00:12,889
I'd like to show you how to make a balloon snake.

4
00:00:13,919 --> 00:00:16,439
This newer model is fairly simple to carry out,

5
00:00:16,439 --> 00:00:17,419
and still...

6
00:00:17,419 --> 00:00:20,419
it's very lifelike. Just wait and see!

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,460
For this, you'll need three modeling balloons.

8
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:29,000
I've opted for two green balloons, 
for the body and the head,

9
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:31,960
and one red balloon, 
for the eyes and tongue.

10
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:37,110
We're going to start by inflating 
the first green balloon,

11
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,840
but not all the way to the tip.

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,160
Leave a wide margin...

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,160
it should be a lot longer 
than the width of your hand.

14
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,100
Tie the knot,

15
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:53,120
and press the rest of the balloon a bit, 
so that it's supple to work with.

16
00:00:54,370 --> 00:00:58,730
We're going to start by twisting a bubble, 
make it nice and round.

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,240
And we're going to keep the bubble in place 
with two fingers, like this.

18
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:07,280
We're going to measure out, roughly,

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,780
about a fifth...

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:12,110
we need five equal parts,

21
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:14,320
so we're going to bend it to get five parts.

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:17,560
And we're only going to use the first two...

23
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:21,280
the first two-fifths of the balloon, like this.

24
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,680
to make a loop.

25
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,860
So don't forget to keep pushing the air 
towards the tip of the balloon.

26
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:37,690
We are now going to...

27
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:41,970
twist a long sausage-shaped bubble, that 
should be the same length as the loop.

28
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:46,910
Just after this sausage bubble, we're going to 
twist a small, round bubble.

29
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:52,790
Then, we're going to bring 
the rest of the balloon...

30
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:55,220
back towards the first sausage bubble,

31
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,220
which is going to allow us to twist
a second sausage bubble,

32
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,140
the same size as the first one.

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:08,440
Press the two sausage bubbles together, 
at their shared base,

34
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,440
and, twist.

35
00:02:13,069 --> 00:02:15,419
There, now you have...

36
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,420
a loop on one side,

37
00:02:18,949 --> 00:02:20,829
and on the other side, two sausage bubbles...

38
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:22,429
and a little round bubble,

39
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:24,099
following those.

40
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:27,100
We are now going to turn this little bubble

41
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:35,940
into a pinch-twist.

42
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,300
There!

43
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,559
Press the rest of the balloon again, 
to push the air forward.

44
00:02:45,559 --> 00:02:50,179
Make sure the sausage bubble...

45
00:02:50,389 --> 00:02:54,529
is the same size as the loop,

46
00:02:55,109 --> 00:02:56,509
and the two other sausage bubbles,

47
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:59,889
and tie a knot.

48
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,240
There we are!

49
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,360
You should have something that looks like this.

50
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,439
Here, we got lucky, because...

51
00:03:05,439 --> 00:03:08,059
the rest of the balloon was just the right length.

52
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,319
If it were too long,

53
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,180
all you'd have to do is let a bit of air out 
(cut the tip then tie a knot).

54
00:03:15,089 --> 00:03:19,449
Now, we can inflate the red balloon.

55
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:23,520
But I don't want the balloon to start...

56
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,700
right there, at the nozzle.

57
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:32,519
So I'm going to guide the air along with my fingers,

58
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,970
so that the balloon's only inflated past a certain point.

59
00:03:37,999 --> 00:03:40,999
Tying a knot.

60
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:45,559
You want the balloon to be about the length...

61
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,859
in fact a bit wider than your hand.

62
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,179
We're going to divide this big sausage bubble,

63
00:03:52,179 --> 00:03:56,199
into two smaller ones, of equal size,

64
00:03:57,020 --> 00:04:02,180
and, tie them together.

65
00:04:08,429 --> 00:04:12,609
Once the knot is done, we're going to take the tip of the balloon,

66
00:04:12,609 --> 00:04:14,749
which still has a bit of air left in it.

67
00:04:14,749 --> 00:04:18,719
And we're going to coil it up, we're going to feed it through to the other side of the two bubbles,

68
00:04:18,719 --> 00:04:24,959
and pass it around the part where the two bubbles meet

69
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:28,570
to have it wedged in like this.

70
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,480
Now, back to the green balloon.

71
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:37,960
And what we're going to do is align the two red eyes,

72
00:04:38,010 --> 00:04:41,650
with the two big, green, sausage bubbles.

73
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,040
The side that's going to become the tongue, 
needs to be facing the same way as the pinch-twist.

74
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,300
Take the balloon knot, and,

75
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:55,340
wedge it at the base of the green loop.

76
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,729
Twist it around a few times.

77
00:04:57,729 --> 00:05:02,249
And, look, I've left a bit of a gap.

78
00:05:02,539 --> 00:05:05,279
It doesn't need to be too tight!

79
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:08,629
Once we've done this,

80
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:11,479
we're going to bring the red eyes...

81
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,520
close to the last sausage bubble,

82
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,280
which has that last little bit of balloon hanging at the end.

83
00:05:18,909 --> 00:05:29,829
And this time, we're going to tie a knot that's very tight.

84
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,569
Take a pair of scissors,

85
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:38,260
and cut off the excess green balloon, 
we won't need it anymore.

86
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:46,960
Next, we need to bring the eyes 
up close to the pinch-twist,

87
00:05:47,849 --> 00:05:54,329
take hold of the tongue, and wrap it around the pinch-twist.

88
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:00,480
Once the tongue is attached...

89
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:03,539
to the pinch-twist, to the base of the pinch-twist,

90
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:26,780
We're going to smooth out the loop.

91
00:06:27,349 --> 00:06:30,349
Like in the tutorial on how to make angles [tutorial 9].

92
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:39,530
Now, we're going to lodge the last sausage bubble,

93
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,130
inside the loop.

94
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:48,190
To do this, you need to go slowly,

95
00:06:50,509 --> 00:06:53,509
There... see... like this.

96
00:06:53,509 --> 00:07:02,689
And we're going to feed the pinch-twist 
through to the other side of the loop.

97
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:08,840
And, of course, the tongue... 
we're going to pass that under as well,

98
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:16,079
and lodge it in-between the base of the loop 
and the pinch-twist.

99
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,320
Like that!

100
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:24,580
Rearrange all the bits of balloon,

101
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:29,680
to get the eyes bulging out on either side,

102
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,080
and there we have it, the snake's head!

103
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,480
Now let's move to the last green balloon,

104
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,100
this one we're going to inflate all the way.

105
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:47,139
But before you tie the knot,

106
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,180
you need to let out a little air,

107
00:07:51,770 --> 00:08:01,170
so the balloon stays supple from nozzle to tip.

108
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,439
Now tie the knot.

109
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:08,619
So here we're going to tie both knots together.

110
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,919
The knot for the snake's body,

111
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:14,000
and the knot behind the small bubble,

112
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,300
that stayed at the base of the snake's head.

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,320
If you have a bit of red balloon sticking out,

114
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,800
you can hide it inside the head,

115
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:35,200
or... cut it off, it's your call!

116
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:42,520
Make the small bubble into a pinch-twist.

117
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:49,820
Then twist a second bubble,

118
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,980
that we're going to make into another pinch-twist.

119
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,020
These two pinch-twists let us...

120
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,100
keep the body and head of the snake fastened together,

121
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:21,960
It also lets us have the whole thing 
face whichever direction we want.

122
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:26,020
For instance, like this, I can have a snake laid out flat,

123
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:35,360
and like this, I can have the snake stick out its head.

124
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:39,100
You decide!

125
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,100
Next, we need to make zigzags in the snake's body.

126
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,230
Here, my first zigzag is facing straight up,

127
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:56,370
and the other ones are facing horizontally.

128
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,570
So, usually,

129
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:03,130
I like to start with longer zigzags,

130
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,300
and finish with shorter ones.

131
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,800
I don't know if you've ever seen how a snake moves in waves,

132
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,920
but often the waves tend to be a lot shorter,

133
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:16,820
towards the tail, than they are nearer the head.

134
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,620
Ok, that's all for today!

135
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,770
So I'll say:

136
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:28,860
See you soon...

137
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:32,130
For another lesson, with Môssieur Ballon !

138
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,840
No! No! Not the fingers!

139
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,560
Not the fingers, aghhh!!!!!
