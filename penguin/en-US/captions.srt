00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Hello!

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,220
Now here is the tutorial for Tux,

3
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:16,500
the penguin that took the 2012 Solutions Linux convention by storm.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
First of all, you need to inflate a black balloon

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:24,500
and leave about the width of a hand, or four fingers, uninflated.

6
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,480
You do the same thing with a white balloon.

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,000
Then... you tie both balloons together.

8
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,080
You start with the white balloon, forming two identical bubbles

9
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:37,820
about three fingers long.

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:44,000
And you block the two bubbles by twisting them together several times around their bases.

11
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:48,500
So, we already have our penguin's two eyes!

12
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,820
Let's now take the black balloon,

13
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,500
and make a wide loop which we'll roll around the eyes like this.

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,180
Then, you turn the loop and the eyes, to lock them together

15
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,500
You push the rest of the air to the end of the black balloon,

16
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,700
And, we're going to fold it into three parts of equal, or roughly equal, length,

17
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,500
actually, the far end of the balloon will have to be a little longer than the first two parts.

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,000
It's quite simple!

19
00:01:17,500 --> 00:01:20,700
First you quickly assess the size of your parts,

20
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:24,000
by making a sort of zigzag, like this!

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:26,500
Once you can make the first fold,

22
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,000
all you'll have to do is form two perfectly identical lengths of balloon,

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,500
that we'll lock together at their base,

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,500
which is also the base of the head of our little mascot.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,500
We've just made its two wings.

26
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,500
Now, we need to create a little bubble at the end of the black balloon,

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,500
so that the part next to the wings is a little shorter,

28
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,000
like this!

29
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,500
And, by locking this bubble between the two wings,

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
we obtain Tux' back and tail!

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:05,000
Let's go back to the white balloon.

32
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,500
At its base we make a well-rounded bubble that we're going to pinch,

33
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,500
and twist to make into sort of ear or bean shape.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,500
We will use this 'bean-bubble' to wedge Tux's head firmly,

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
above its wings and back.

36
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:24,500
And the rest of the white balloon will come in front,

37
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
to allow us to shape the stomach.

38
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,500
So, air control...

39
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,500
You form a length of balloon which should be much longer than the back,

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,000
and lock it beneath the two wings around the tail and the base of the back.

41
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,000
Give it a shape so that it forms a slightly round belly,

42
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:46,000
Well, a bit like the aptly-named Môssieur Ballon (Mister Balloon)!

43
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,500
So, air control again...

44
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
but this time, we're pushing the air all the way to the end.

45
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,000
You shape a small round bubble at the end of the white balloon,

46
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,000
and lock it at the base of the wings, around the tail and the base of the back.

47
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,000
It doesn't matter which side the bubble comes out from for the moment.

48
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,500
We fold the big white loop thusly shaped into two equal parts,

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
just to mark where the half of this loop is located,

50
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,000
and we use this mark to divide

51
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:17,500
the loop into two equal parts, by pressing

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,500
and turning them just like this.

53
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Refine the shape of the two loops to have them well-rounded,

54
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:29,000
Also put the finishing touches on the tail, to give him a little curved shape,

55
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:33,500
and there, our penguin is starting to take shape,

56
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,500
except it's missing a little beak!

57
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,000
The simplest solution is to take a little round balloon,

58
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:43,540
or even to cut off the end of a yellow modelling balloon.

59
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,260
Since I have a lot of little round balloons, I'll use one.

60
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
Firstly, inflate it normally,

61
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
then deflate it a little, until it takes on a slightly pointy shape.

62
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:01,000
If needed press a little on the end of the balloon,

63
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:07,000
so that the air stays confined towards the balloon knot.

64
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:10,940
All we need to do now is to block the knot of the yellow balloon

65
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,500
around the 'pinch-twist' at the base of the head.

66
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Refine the shape of the beak any which way you like,

67
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,700
and you can also force the black loop of the penguin's head,

68
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:30,500
between its eyes a little so that they show more.

69
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,500
And finally, a bit of black marker on the eyes,

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,500
and it's done!

71
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,100
OK, now Tux and I,

72
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:41,500
have some coding to do!

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,880
So... see you soon,

74
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,500
for another lesson, with... Môssieur Ballon!
