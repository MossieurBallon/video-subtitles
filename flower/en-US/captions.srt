00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,880
Today, MÃ´ssieur Ballon will teach you...

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:13,330
how to make a flower!

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,500
To make the petals of the flower,

4
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,500
we are going to start by inflating a balloon all the way to the tip,

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,550
without leaving any room at the end.

6
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:25,770
However, once the balloon is fully inflated,

7
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:29,310
we will need to let the air escape a little bit,

8
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,800
to lower the pressure and soften the balloon.

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,300
Then, by pressing the tip of the balloon,

10
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:39,110
we can give ourselves a slightly wider margin,

11
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,180
which we will attach to the balloon knot

12
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,520
to form one big loop.

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,260
Make sure the air pressure is evenly balanced...

14
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:50,350
all along the big loop.

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:53,310
Then, stretching the balloon like this,

16
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,079
find the halfway mark on the loop,

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,710
which needs to be exactly opposite the knot,

18
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,290
in order to get two segments of equal length.

19
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:05,000
Then, take the two segments together in your hands,

20
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,920
being sure to divide their length...

21
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:10,119
into three parts as equal as possible.

22
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:12,549
Ok, this next bit will be a bit tricky!

23
00:01:12,549 --> 00:01:15,869
With each of your hands, alternating each time,

24
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:20,060
you need to press and twist the two segments around together

25
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:21,820
as if you were making a regular bubble,

26
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,760
except here, you're making 2 bubbles together,

27
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,299
and on top of it your hands can't move entirely freely

28
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:31,049
because they're working more or less at the same time...

29
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,200
on two different parts of the balloon.

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,429
Feel free to pause the video,

31
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,670
try it a couple of times, you should get the hang of it eventually.

32
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:43,050
Once you have your 6 balloon segments made,

33
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:48,179
place them in a zigzag like this.

34
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:51,099
Press, bring the 6 parts together,

35
00:01:51,099 --> 00:01:53,959
taking them between your thumb and forefinger, like this.

36
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:59,409
Next take 3 petals from the same side of the zigzag

37
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,899
and twist them around their base,

38
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:05,779
to keep all the petals together in place.

39
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:11,040
Then, move away your thumb and forefinger,

40
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:13,000
and arrange the petals more nicely.

41
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,200
There... the hardest part is over!

42
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,370
Now let's take another balloon,

43
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,019
green preferably, to make the stem.

44
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:24,310
Inflate it leaving a margin of about three fingers,

45
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,010
tie the knot, and evenly spread out the air pressure.

46
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,480
We're going to start with a tulip-twist.

47
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,469
As a reminder, it's about pushing the knot...

48
00:02:33,469 --> 00:02:36,760
back inside the balloon with your forefinger,

49
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,269
you gently pull out your finger

50
00:02:38,269 --> 00:02:41,090
and finally, press and twist,

51
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,790
to keep the tulip-twist in place.

52
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,890
Let's go back to the petals,

53
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:49,170
stretching apart any two at random,

54
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:51,090
in order to give us enough space

55
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:56,049
to house the base of the tulip-twist up to the center of the petals.

56
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:00,920
To minimize pressure and avoid one of either balloons bursting,

57
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:04,689
you need to push the tulip-twist gently...

58
00:03:04,689 --> 00:03:07,099
twisting it slightly,

59
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,480
rather than forcing it all in one go.

60
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,739
Once the core of the flower is firmly seated in the middle of the petals,

61
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:16,959
make a small little bubble, then a second one of the same size,

62
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,979
which we'll make into a pinch-twist.

63
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:33,440
The idea is that the petals of the flower should be parallel to the stem.

64
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,319
Control the air one last time...

65
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,879
so that there's no room left in the remaining portion of balloon

66
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,069
and the air pressure in it is evenly spread out.

67
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:50,319
We are now going to make a zigzag with the remaining portion of balloon,

68
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,969
and place our hand at the center of the zigzag.

69
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:58,879
The last segment of the balloon, and the segment supporting the petals,

70
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,219
should both stick out a little from the zigzag.

71
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:05,639
Press and block the center of the zigzag,

72
00:04:05,639 --> 00:04:08,409
by pivoting each side of the zigzag,

73
00:04:08,409 --> 00:04:11,829
opposite to each other, with your thumb and forefinger.

74
00:04:11,829 --> 00:04:13,829
Like this, we have formed, in one single motion,

75
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:18,010
two loops of equal size which will form the leaves of the flower.

76
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:23,580
Make sure the bottom and top of the stem are centered in the middle of the leaves.

77
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,680
Give the stem a little curve so that its shape looks a bit more natural...

78
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,080
And there!

79
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,500
Say it with flowers!

80
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:33,400
So!

81
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,040
See you soon...

82
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:35,880
for another lesson...

83
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,380
with Mossieur Ballon !
