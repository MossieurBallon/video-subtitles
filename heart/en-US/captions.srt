00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,860
Hi!

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,980
Swords? Those are for boys...

3
00:00:10,340 --> 00:00:11,700
What about the girls?

4
00:00:12,919 --> 00:00:14,079
I know, love hearts!

5
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:17,629
Well, actually... That was before!

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,400
To start, inflate a balloon completely.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,300
But before tying the knot...

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,160
you'll have to let out a bit of air,

9
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:29,920
this leaves the balloon supple and malleable.

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:34,229
Make sure air pressure is evenly balanced...

11
00:00:34,229 --> 00:00:36,220
from the knot to the tip of the balloon.

12
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,680
Then, twist a small bubble just after the knot.

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,140
Next...

14
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,200
bring the end of the balloon beside the bubble,

15
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,800
and embed it into the crease,

16
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,480
so as to form another bubble.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:52,780
This second bubble should be a bit larger than the first.

18
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:53,890
Next...

19
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,870
Go back to the first bubble, the one ending with the knot,

20
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,050
and make it into a pinch-twist.

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:04,070
The pinch-twist should sit in the gap...

22
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:07,530
formed by the intersection of the loop and the bigger bubble.

23
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,050
Check one more time that the air pressure...

24
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:17,580
is equally distributed the full length of the loop.

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,240
Then, using the middle of the loop as your bearing...

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,100
grab each side of the loop in your hands,

27
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,860
and bring them together.

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,460
This way, you fold the loop into two perfectly equal parts.

29
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:40,870
Form an acute angle from this bend.

30
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:47,960
Accentuate the curve of the top of each side of the love heart.

31
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,290
To finish...

32
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,190
look at the love heart sideways, to check its alignment,

33
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:10,070
and make corrections as needed.

34
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,129
There !

35
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,000
I love you!

36
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:19,229
See you soon,

37
00:02:19,229 --> 00:02:21,909
For another lesson... with MÃ´ssieur Ballon!

38
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:22,829
Thump thump...

39
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:23,620
Thump thump...
