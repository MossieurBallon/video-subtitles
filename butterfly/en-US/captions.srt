00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,730
Hello!

2
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:10,610
How would you like to learn how to make a little butterfly?

3
00:00:12,749 --> 00:00:15,009
You need to inflate a balloon all the way,

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,860
then let out a bit of air to bring pressure down.

5
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:20,969
The balloon should be fairly soft.

6
00:00:21,509 --> 00:00:23,089
Then...

7
00:00:23,089 --> 00:00:27,710
tie both ends together to form a large loop,

8
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:32,420
make sure that the air is evenly distributed along the loop,

9
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,390
mark the middle of the loop, on the opposite side from the knot,

10
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,320
and divide the loop into two segments of equal length.

11
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,240
Hold both segments together, side by side,

12
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:48,680
and mark, roughly, the third of their length.

13
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,670
But careful !

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:55,950
You need to divide the two segments together, at slightly -more- than a third of their length,

15
00:00:55,950 --> 00:00:59,170
so that one side is made larger, and the other… smaller.

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:04,100
Bend the balloon to bring both ends together,

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,440
then, bring them towards the central crease,

18
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,820
so as to form four loops.

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,080
Next, twist them together at their base several times, to lock all four loops in place.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:19,000
It’s practically the same sequence as for creating the petals of the flower,

21
00:01:19,189 --> 00:01:23,270
only it’s easier as there are only four loops, rather than six.

22
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:25,390
We have just made the butterfly’s wings,

23
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:27,680
which we will set aside for now,

24
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,420
for example by wedging them under one arm.

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,660
Next, take another balloon, preferably one in a lighter colour,

26
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:37,970
as we’ll be drawing on it later on.

27
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:39,680
Inflate it in the middle...

28
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,620
about a finger long (in length, or about four fingers in width).

29
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,080
So… as a reminder,

30
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:47,520
if you are not yet able to inflate the balloon straight in the middle

31
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:50,680
well you can always inflate the balloon normally

32
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,220
then push the bubble forward manually,

33
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:56,280
until it is positioned at the center of the balloon,

34
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,560
and the two lengths of balloon left deflated...

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,000
are, roughly, of the same size, on either side of the bubble.

36
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:05,460
Next, curve the bubble at the center of the balloon,

37
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,090
to form a small loop.

38
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:13,680
Then tie each end of the balloon at the base of this loop.

39
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:17,809
We now have the two antennae!

40
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,060
However, air pressure shouldn’t be too high in this small loop,

41
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:27,200
because we are now about to divide it as well into two more bubbles,

42
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:31,759
a larger one… and a smaller one… like this!

43
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:36,380
Then, you turn the smaller bubble into a pinch-twist.

44
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:44,159
The bigger bubble will automatically become a tiny… little… mini loop.

45
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:50,289
We now have the head, body, and antennae of our butterfly.

46
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:54,269
All that’s left is to assemble this part with the wings.

47
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:58,159
The easiest solution is to hold the pinch-twist and antennae...

48
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:00,949
in your twisting hand,

49
00:03:00,949 --> 00:03:06,349
while leaving the mini loop stick out from between your middle finger and forefinger.

50
00:03:06,349 --> 00:03:10,929
We are going to twist this mini loop around the crease of the butterfly wings,

51
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,140
to block the two balloons together.

52
00:03:13,149 --> 00:03:15,749
A single twist should be enough.

53
00:03:15,749 --> 00:03:18,949
Having the antennae tucked away in your hand...

54
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,380
will help prevent them from getting tangled in the loops.

55
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,219
Next, adjust everything in place, the two larger wings facing upward,

56
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:31,439
the head pinch-twist also facing upward, as well as the two antennae,

57
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,299
which should stick out between the head and the upper wings.

58
00:03:35,299 --> 00:03:39,009
Draw on its eyes, eyebrows, a big smile,

59
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:40,529
and that does the trick!

60
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:42,669
Butterflies...

61
00:03:42,669 --> 00:03:44,209
are cute!

62
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:47,459
Even cuter when they’re sitting on a flower!

63
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,430
So… see you soon!

64
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,999
For another lesson with...

65
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:52,339
Môssieur Ballon!
