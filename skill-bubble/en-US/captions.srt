Hello!

2
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,500
Today I'd like to go over

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
a couple basic techniques with you.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,500
for example: bubbles!

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,800
First, you press the balloon until you form a kind of fold

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,000
and, twist the balloon at the level of the fold.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:28,500
Then, keep pressing and turning. That's it!

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
But be careful! You need to always...

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
twist the balloon around at least three times for each bubble,

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,000
and always, always in the same direction!

11
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:39,600
So, you can make bubbles of all kinds of different sizes,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,500
little ones, big ones... it doesn't matter!

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,700
But no need to contort yourself, to twist your hands every which way;

14
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
or to try to block the bubbles against your chest so they won't spin away,

15
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,500
No... i'm going to tell you a secret!

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,500
All you need to do is hold the first bubble with one hand

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
and the far end of the balloon with the other hand.

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:05,700
And look at that, the bubbles in the middle stay put

19
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,500
and you can keep doing this for as long as you want!

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Press... twist! Press... twist!

21
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Go on... practise at home

22
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,200
Make a whole bunch... and you'll see that

23
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,000
as long as you keep holding the first bubble in one hand...

24
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:23,200
and the far end of the balloon in the other hand...

25
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,300
the bubbles in the middle won't get undone

26
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,200
if you've been mindful...

27
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,000
to twist the balloon all the way around at least three times for each bubble

28
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,700
and always in the same direction, like I showed you.

29
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,700
To finish, well... you block the row of bubbles,

30
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,300
by locking the first one together with the last,

31
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
and turning them together several times...

32
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,600
like this!

33
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,700
There you go! Bubbles aren't very complicated!

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,000
All it takes is practice, that's all!

35
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:59,500
So, do practise, make some rows of bubbles of different sizes,

36
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,500
and... some pretty necklaces.

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,900
So... see you soon,

38
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,500
for a new lesson... with MÃ´ssieur Ballon!
