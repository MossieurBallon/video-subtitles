1
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:10,460
Well, a promise made is a promise kept!

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,280
MÃ´ssieur Ballon has decided to share his secrets with you.

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,700
Naturally, we're going to start 

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,380
with the basics of balloon sculpture,

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,120
learning to make a little dog.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,340
So... first things first...

7
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:28,160
we'll inflate this balloon,

8
00:00:29,189 --> 00:00:30,989
but not all the way to the tip!

9
00:00:30,989 --> 00:00:31,980
You see...

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,960
I'm leaving about... Say, four fingers wide!

11
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,040
Four fingers... ok, I can deflate it a little.

12
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:41,370
I make a knot...

13
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:43,390
and... So, don't worry, 

14
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,600
I am going pretty fast...

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,139
I'm going pretty fast,

16
00:00:47,139 --> 00:00:50,139
but we'll look over all this again from scratch.

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,020
And what we have... is the little dog!

18
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:02,020
So while I'm starting the little dog over...

19
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:05,660
I'd like to remind...

20
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:06,840
you to...

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,540
inflate a balloon,

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,860
and leave about...

23
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,460
four fingers...

24
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:16,550
deflated !

25
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:20,420
So, one sausage...

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,960
two sausages...

27
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,960
three sausages...

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,300
while making sure...

29
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:29,760
the last two sausages...

30
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,140
are the same size.

31
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:32,640
So, if they're not the same size

32
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,820
at this point it's not too late to start over

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,840
Put them side by side...

34
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:38,840
And...

35
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,300
Press... at their base

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,120
and twist the last two sausages...

37
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,460
several times (together).

38
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,360
And there, you'll see...

39
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,420
the dog's head, 

40
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,920
and two ears.

41
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,200
Now, for the neck..

42
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:55,840
It'll be a little bubble,

43
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,960
that's all!

44
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,980
So... to make our sausages...

45
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,860
if you're wondering,

46
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,520
all you need to do is press...

47
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,900
press the balloon,

48
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:05,840
and twist it at the same time,

49
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,840
that's it!

50
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,360
Now, to make sure that the two legs...

51
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,380
are the same size,

52
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,640
I press and twist them 

53
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,640
side by side...

54
00:02:14,149 --> 00:02:17,509
so I'm sure they're the same size.

55
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:18,989
Moving on.

56
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:21,100
From time to time I press on the balloon,

57
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:22,749
to push air towards the reserve.

58
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,500
A little stomach...

59
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,140
one hind leg...

60
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:33,540
two hind legs...

61
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,140
straighten all this out...

62
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,000
and... here's the puppy dog !

63
00:02:40,749 --> 00:02:42,560
How could we...

64
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,689
make this dog better ?

65
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Well first,

66
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,980
we could give it...

67
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,860
slightly more rounded shapes,

68
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,880
because it's a balloon

69
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:52,089
but everything...

70
00:02:52,089 --> 00:02:53,809
is totally straight !

71
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,460
So, look...

72
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,840
already by doing this little thing...

73
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,960
I'm going to...

74
00:03:01,389 --> 00:03:02,780
give my dog's...

75
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,620
tail...

76
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,600
a little shape !

77
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,280
Next, for the stomach...

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,480
same thing...

79
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,240
all we need...

80
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,360
is to press a little like this...

81
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,700
and you can see it gives him 

82
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:15,060
a cute-looking little tummy!

83
00:03:16,899 --> 00:03:17,890
Like we did...

84
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:20,709
with the first version of the little dog

85
00:03:20,709 --> 00:03:23,629
you press between the ears, and turn! 

86
00:03:23,629 --> 00:03:27,460
But here, instead of leaving the ears... on top,

87
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:30,399
it's... shall we say... the German Shepherd style!

88
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,560
We're going to do this one Cocker style,

89
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,520
with its ears drooping down.

90
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:38,840
So we're going to use the knot, 

91
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,699
which we're going to take out...

92
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,600
and which we'll wedge...

93
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,260
at the base of the ears !

94
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:46,540
Then, 

95
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,200
we're going to wedge this part,

96
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,600
by twisting the ears and pulling them apart.

97
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,780
Now this makes it...

98
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,160
a bit more complicated,

99
00:03:56,169 --> 00:03:58,689
but you can see it gives us a dog's head...

100
00:03:58,689 --> 00:03:59,929
that's slightly different.

101
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,740
So that we recognize it better

102
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:05,540
we're going to draw... its nose, its eyes...

103
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,220
There!

104
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,681
So, back to work,

105
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,180
now I'll make one...

106
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:15,440
at my normal speed,

107
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:17,869
and you'll try,

108
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,859
to make it alongside me.

109
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,119
If you can do it...

110
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:25,300
well, you're very close

111
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,400
to a professional level...

112
00:04:27,409 --> 00:04:29,109
and you should maybe consider

113
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,940
not just doing this for fun, 

114
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,860
but making a job of it!

115
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,200
Normally, it takes a little under a minute...

116
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,260
maximum, to make a dog like this,

117
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,740
maybe even... a few seconds.

118
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,060
So you'll see, that as I go along 

119
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,460
I'm controlling the air that's inside the balloon.

120
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,780
And that's what makes the difference

121
00:05:01,789 --> 00:05:03,029
between a beginner,

122
00:05:03,029 --> 00:05:06,649
and someone more used to this,

123
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:10,430
it's really controlling the air in your balloons.

124
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:13,110
If you don't control it,

125
00:05:15,779 --> 00:05:17,659
one of two things can happen...

126
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,380
And here's the doggy!

127
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:23,569
If you don't control the air in the balloon,

128
00:05:23,569 --> 00:05:25,249
one of two things can happen:

129
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,959
either

130
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:31,379
the balloon will be too inflated and will burst

131
00:05:31,379 --> 00:05:32,839
or the opposite will happen, 

132
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,560
it won't stay together and will get undone.

133
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:37,360
There!

134
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:42,430
What have we learned making the little dog?

135
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:44,720
Well, we've learned several things.

136
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,020
First, we have learned...

137
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:50,400
that you must never inflate the balloon all the way.

138
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,080
You must always leave a little reserve for the air.

139
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:56,269
As you go along...

140
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,200
handling the balloon and tying knots,

141
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:04,400
the air will fill the room left for it...

142
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,520
At the far end of the balloon.

143
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,400
Secondly, we've learned to make balloon sausages.

144
00:06:10,669 --> 00:06:13,989
To make a sausage, all you need to do is to press and twist! 

145
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:16,980
Thirdly, we've learned...

146
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,620
that you need only hold the beginning and end of the balloon,

147
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:21,699
and not worry about the middle

148
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,980
which allows you to make a whole string of sausages 

149
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:28,740
without it ever getting undone.

150
00:06:28,939 --> 00:06:32,819
No need to go this way, or go like this...

151
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,300
It's very complicated like this, isn't it? 

152
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,460
There's no need, you only need to hold the beginning, and the end!

153
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,860
What else have we learned?

154
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,920
We've learned to make little bubbles.

155
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:45,840
This is going to be very important for the end.

156
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,160
Little bubbles are like sausages, only smaller.

157
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,480
Cocktail sausages!

158
00:06:53,749 --> 00:06:54,949
There!

159
00:06:55,619 --> 00:06:56,939
Then, 

160
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,100
one last thing,

161
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,330
a word of advice,

162
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,680
control the air well!

163
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:05,260
The issue beginners encounter...

164
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,480
is that often, the beginning of the balloon...

165
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,900
will be so inflated it's bursting at the seams...

166
00:07:09,909 --> 00:07:13,469
and at the end, there's still room for air

167
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:16,249
what you need to do is, as you go along... 

168
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:18,989
to press the balloon, just like this!

169
00:07:18,989 --> 00:07:22,649
See, when I press the balloon

170
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:24,259
the reserve fills up.

171
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,220
Look!

172
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:30,300
So, gradually,

173
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:34,860
you make a sausage, a second sausage, a third sausage,

174
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,300
and there, you press the balloon a little,

175
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,860
to make sure the pressure

176
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:45,689
is balanced from start to finish.

177
00:07:45,689 --> 00:07:48,109
Make sure to practise, and: See you soon!

178
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,900
for our next lesson...

179
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,560
with MÃ´ssieur Ballon!
