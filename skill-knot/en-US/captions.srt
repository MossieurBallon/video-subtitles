Hello!

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,700
I would now like to,

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
simply,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:15,000
go over how to make a balloon knot!

5
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,000
Here's the trick I use,

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,000
it may not be the only one or even the best one, but it works.

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,200
With one hand, you hold the end of the balloon between your thumb and forefinger,

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,000
so that the opening is directed inwards towards your palm.

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,600
With the other hand, you pull on the opening of the balloon,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,800
to get a good length of latex to work with.

11
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:42,800
You then position the middle finger of the first hand at the middle of this length,

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,570
And turn it, moving your thumb away,

13
00:00:46,570 --> 00:00:51,500
so that there's a very wide loop around the ring and middle fingers,

14
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,500
which are like hooks pointed towards your palm.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,000
From behind you insert the opening of the balloon into the loop,

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,500
and pull on it to tighten the knot.

17
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:06,000
That's the trick!

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:08,500
I hope this was clear.

19
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,000
See you soon,

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,500
for another lesson with MÃ´ssieur Ballon!
