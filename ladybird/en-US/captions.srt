Hi!

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,620
Today, Mossieur Ballon will teach you how to make a ladybird!

3
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:19,000
For the body of the ladybird, we'll need a small, red, round balloon,

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,440
which we will then inflate... but not too much!

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,400
The knot should be tied right at the valve...

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,880
and we will push most of the air towards the neck of the balloon

7
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,040
which will then take the shape of a pear, that we'll divide into two parts

8
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,680
to form a small bubble and a large one.

9
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,980
Then, keep the red balloon under one of your arms,

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,440
to avoid the bubbles getting undone.

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,400
Next, for the antennae, you will need a black modeling balloon

12
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,480
with only the middle of it inflated,

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,680
over a length of about 5 to 6 fingers maximum.

14
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,300
So if you can't do that in one go, like I did here,

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,980
you can just inflate a balloon normally,

16
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,060
a bit more than halfway, then let some of the air out,

17
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:02,820
until both sides are about the same length.

18
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,069
Make sure the black bubble is evenly centered,

19
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:09,880
and divide it into two smaller bubbles which will be wedged

20
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,020
 between the large and small bubbles of the red balloon.

21
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,100
Next, divide each black bubble into two parts again,

22
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,960
and by pressing the second bubble,

23
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,760
you're pushing all the air from it and guiding it...

24
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:24,179
towards the tip of the balloon segment.

25
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,420
To finish, 

26
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,260
secure the bubble at the tip of the antenna

27
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,179
with a knot

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,400
Do the same thing for the second antenna,

29
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,020
but this time, let's try not tying a knot here,

30
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,440
just to see!

31
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:46,140
Well, if ever a child were to press a bubble that's been secured with a knot,

32
00:01:46,149 --> 00:01:48,109
there would be no problem.

33
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:54,049
However, if that same child were to press a bubble that hasn't been secured with a knot,

34
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,319
well this is what would happen, wouldn't that be a shame!

35
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:02,849
So, to be safe, we'd better tie a knot here!

36
00:02:02,849 --> 00:02:06,989
To finish... draw a cute little face on the small red bubble,

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,580
two little eyes, and a big smile.

38
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,860
The knot , in fact, will be its nose.

39
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,240
Then, on the large bubble, draw wings with black spots!

40
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,500
So, doesn't this little ladybird look nice?

41
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:40,810
See you soon! 

42
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:43,790
for another lesson... with MÃ´ssieur Ballon!
