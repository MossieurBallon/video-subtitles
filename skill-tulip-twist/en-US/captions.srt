Hello !

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:10,140
I would now like us to work...

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:13,540
on a technique called: "tulip twist"

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,140
We must insert an index into the balloon this way,

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:22,740
so that we push the balloon knot inside the ballon.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:25,860
Then, the idea, with the other hand...

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:29,980
is to catch the knot through the balloon skin,

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,180
and hold it firmly!

9
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,380
Once the knot is held securely with the other hand,

10
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,720
we must very carefully extirpate the index from the balloon,

11
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,740
with the help of the thumb and the major if necessary,

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,879
Be very careful not to do this too bruskly,

13
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,099
otherwise the balloon could burst!

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:58,420
And finally, just twist the balloon,  

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,360
just like you would while making a classic bubble!

16
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,280
The knot is now stuck...

17
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,740
on the other side of the tulip-twist.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,340
Now, if we want to use the tulip-twist for a flower,

19
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,080
all we would do is insert the petals directly in this fold.

20
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,820
On the other hand, if we wanted to leave use the tulip-twist on its own,

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,860
we would have to push back the balloon knot... in this fashion

22
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,020
a little bit inside the tulip-twist,

23
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,820
to lock the knot a bit more securely.

24
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,400
You will see, tulip-twists" are used, 

25
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,820
for example to make flowers,

26
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,380
where they go in between petals,

27
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,380
we will soon see that in another lesson.

28
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,090
Also, to make car wheels, for example,

29
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:43,020
etc, etc, it's a very important technique...

30
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:45,400
which you must learn to master!

31
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,650
That's it for today.

32
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:48,340
See you very soon, 

33
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:50,200
for another lesson...

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,460
with MÃ´ssieur Ballon!
