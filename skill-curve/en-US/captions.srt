Hello, nice to see you again!

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,500
This time I'd like to work on curves!

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Making curves with balloons!

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,700
All you have to do is rub the balloon (against itself) like this

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
gradually moving on,

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:33,419
until the balloon has done a full rotation.

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,000
This gives us a circle.

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,500
To get a spiral, the process is almost the same.

9
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,000
As we did for the circle, you rub the balloon against itself,

10
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,000
but this time, don't let go of the balloon just yet,

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,500
it has to keep the shape of a tense spring,

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
while you keep turning it around itself.

13
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,900
Then, you take both ends of the balloon and pull them away from each other,

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,400
Then, very gently, let go!

15
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,900
So, there you go, practice making your own spirals, and circles...

16
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:19,000
And... see you soon!

17
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,200
For another lesson... with MÃ´ssieur Ballon!
