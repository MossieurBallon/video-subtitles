00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,860
Hi!

2
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:10,259
I'd like to talk

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,900
about air control.

4
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:15,200
Not the air you breathe,

5
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:19,439
but the air blown into balloons.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:24,920
There are two issues you may encounter.

7
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:26,710
First case to highlight,

8
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:28,710
the balloon is much too inflated!

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,330
It's very compressed, and the air almost reaches the tip

10
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,100
Second case,

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,380
conversely, the balloon isn't inflated nearly enough!

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:39,499
It's all soft,

13
00:00:39,499 --> 00:00:41,859
and there's far too much room at the end.

14
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,460
Let's start with the one that's too inflated.

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,480
The idea, is to keep the air....

16
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,240
as much as possible, at the front of the balloon.

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,620
And whatever you do...

18
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,180
don't push it towards the end.

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,820
So for starters, we're going to cheat a little...

20
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,280
by pulling on the knot,

21
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,440
to recover some space,

22
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,460
and give the air...

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,480
a bit more room.

24
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:07,850
Next, we're going to be very careful...

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,660
not to press the balloon more than we have to,

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,720
and we're going to keep the balloon as compressed as possible.

27
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:18,140
To do this, as an exception, we're going to twist the balloon as little as possible,

28
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,240
because the more you twist the balloon...

29
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,880
the more you're pushing air towards the end.

30
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,160
And that's exactly what we want to avoid!

31
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,000
So, only go around once, that's enough.

32
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,000
So of course...

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,040
when the balloon is very compressed like this,

34
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,960
it's best to handle it with precaution...

35
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,420
and a little slower than usual.

36
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,400
and you can see that for now, I've been able... 

37
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,420
to keep my margin at the end of the balloon,

38
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:46,040
just by limiting how much i twist the bubbles,

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,120
and by avoiding pressure on the balloon.

40
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:52,360
Oh! Here I've reached the end of the balloon,

41
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,280
and I'm out of room.

42
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,460
We're going to cheat again a little,

43
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,110
Instead of making segments one by one,

44
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:04,200
I'm going to divide the rest of my balloon in two.

45
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,600
Just two portions of equivalent pressure.

46
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,860
And later, I'm going to divide them in two as well.

47
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,860
You'll see!

48
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,280
This way, I'm evenly spreading out...

49
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,160
air pressure between the last four segments.

50
00:02:18,359 --> 00:02:19,519
Let me check... 

51
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:22,570
Yes, pressure is balanced between the front legs,

52
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,949
the stomach, hind legs, and tail.

53
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,840
I'll still try to give the tail...

54
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:29,680
a slightly more natural shape, and there!

55
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:33,100
To sum up, if your balloon is too inflated...

56
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,620
you need to make sure that pressure doesn't go...

57
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,309
toward the end of the balloon right away,

58
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,160
but stays balanced,

59
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:42,760
throughout your sculpture

60
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:45,880
Now, with the under-inflated balloon,

61
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,540
we're going to do the exact opposite.

62
00:02:48,829 --> 00:02:50,609
When the balloon was too inflated,

63
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:52,880
we were trying to keep the air in the front.

64
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,440
Here, on the other hand...

65
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,100
our strategy will be to push the air...

66
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,600
as much as possible to the back of the balloon.

67
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,200
And if necessary,

68
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:04,100
you can even block the balloon between your arm and side

69
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,040
to force the air even further back.

70
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,220
And here look...

71
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:11,699
we've already been able to shorten the reserve a great deal.

72
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,479
OK, next it's like usual,

73
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,200
except we're going to twist the balloon...

74
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,260
as much as possible,

75
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,599
when making the bubbles.

76
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,760
So instead of twisting the bubbles three times, you'll twist...

77
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,420
say, ten times if you have to!

78
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,860
Remember...

79
00:03:25,339 --> 00:03:27,739
twisting the balloon takes up space,

80
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,420
and pushes the air back.

81
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,879
And in this case...

82
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,999
that's exactly what we want to do.

83
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,939
So, press the balloon well when forming bubbles,

84
00:03:35,939 --> 00:03:39,389
and keep regularly pushing the air in the balloon back,

85
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:42,959
as soon as air pressure builds up after a few bubbles

86
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,120
You'll need to compress the balloon with both your hands,

87
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,580
even your arm if you have to.

88
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,569
Each time you block bubbles, for example...

89
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,569
here, at the legs,

90
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,869
keep twisting the balloon more than necessary.

91
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,800
And continue like this, 

92
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:01,580
each time, pressing a little more, 

93
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,140
to form the bubbles and the different sections of the balloon.

94
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,470
And this time, we can afford to...

95
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,850
strongly accentuate the natural shape...

96
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,660
of the tail and stomach

97
00:04:19,209 --> 00:04:20,529
And at the end, look...

98
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,580
We completely made up the huge margin

99
00:04:23,590 --> 00:04:25,430
of empty balloon we had at the beginning.

100
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:28,340
Now, let's compare both figures together...

101
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,139
You can see that in spite of the balloons being very badly inflated at the start

102
00:04:32,139 --> 00:04:35,199
we've still been able to make our little doggies 

103
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,979
in both cases, and without popping them...

104
00:04:37,979 --> 00:04:40,789
or conversely, without the balloon getting undone.

105
00:04:40,789 --> 00:04:43,560
All this, just by mastering...

106
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,020
air  pressure control.

107
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,080
Air control is paramount!

108
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:54,830
It makes the difference between a pro and a beginner,

109
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,420
the difference between a balloon...

110
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,520
that pops in some poor kid's hands,

111
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:03,240
or a balloon that gets undone by itself,

112
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,160
through lack of tension,

113
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:09,349
so, practice controlling air in balloons.

114
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,460
See you soon!

115
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,380
for another lesson with... MÃ´ssieur Ballon !
