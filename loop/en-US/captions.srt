Hello !

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,199
Today, we will learn a very simple technique...

3
00:00:11,199 --> 00:00:12,579
The loop !

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,140
Générally, we make a loop right after another bubble,

5
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:17,400
Whatever the size of the bubble

6
00:00:17,659 --> 00:00:21,659
To make a loop, we simply have to bend the balloon,

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,600
And then, to determine the size of the loop,

8
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,120
do exactly what we learned with the classic bubble :

9
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:30,120
Press and turn !

10
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,420
To lock it, we simply have to join...

11
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:37,220
and hold together the two extremities of the loop,

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,080
while we make it rotate a few times

13
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:42,640
on itself, this way.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:46,540
And that's it!  See you very soon,

15
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:48,140
for a new lesson...

16
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,600
with Môssieur Ballon!
