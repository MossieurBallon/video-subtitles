00:00:04,790 --> 00:00:08,590
Hello, and welcome on Môssieur Ballon's website.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,440
Today, Mossieur Ballon will teach you...

3
00:00:11,450 --> 00:00:14,390
How to make a frog.

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:19,429
This time I won't be teaching you any new techniques.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,500
What you've learned... with the puppy dog,

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,460
and with the sword... will be enough...

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:29,460
to make this frog!

8
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:33,080
So like we did for the dog, we're going to blow up a balloon,

9
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:37,300
and leave about the width... the width of a hand.

10
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,560
we're going to leave about a hand's width...

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:43,580
which won't be inflated.

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:46,880
We tie our little knot...

13
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:54,980
and we're going to start by making... a bubble...

14
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,940
two bubbles... three bubbles...

15
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,700
Remember, there is no need to hold the bubbles in the middle.

16
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,140
You hold the beginning and you hold the end!

17
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,980
One bubble, two bubbles, three bubbles, four bubbles...

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,340
and you take the knot of the balloon...

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,940
which you then hook up to the base of the fourth bubble.

20
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,180
So you can see I still have it (between my fingers)...

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,180
and I'm just turning... and turning (all four bubbles)... and... there,

22
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:24,840
to make sure it's secure, I'm passing it (the knot) in the middle (of the four bubbles).

23
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:28,230
And here's the shape I get, try to get this shape yourself.

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,540
Then, we're going to make another shape...

25
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,460
that we've come across with the sword... a loop, a small loop!

26
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:39,140
So, to give you an idea of the size of the loop,

27
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,040
we'd want it a little bit bigger than...

28
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:46,250
the four little bubbles.

29
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,120
So, this time, I'm going to press my balloon

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,940
to push the air towards the reserve, so that this loop is...

31
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:59,140
not too inflated. It actually needs to be... quite soft.

32
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,520
But not too soft!

33
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:05,980
Try a couple of times until you find the right consistency.

34
00:02:06,390 --> 00:02:09,130
Here's... what I've made!

35
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,000
So, before you tell me this doesn't really look like a frog

36
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,840
Here's what we'll do now...

37
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,619
the two little bubbles on top are going to be wedged...

38
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:22,660
inside the loop. So to do this...

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:27,700
I  pass both of my forefingers through the loop...

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,960
on the other side, with my thumbs, i'm going to force...

41
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,320
those (top) two bubbles into the loop...

42
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,620
and then, take out my fingers!

43
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,380
And you can see... that here, we just have...

44
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:45,959
the frog's two eyes!

45
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,880
What do you think?

46
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:55,080
We're going to keep pressing the balloon so that...

47
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,500
the lining (of the balloon) isn't too strained.

48
00:02:58,029 --> 00:03:00,789
Another little bubble...

49
00:03:00,789 --> 00:03:05,669
that you're going to make into a "bean", what's known as a pinch-twist!

50
00:03:07,559 --> 00:03:09,599
What's a pinch-twist? It's simple!

51
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,460
All you have to do is place your finger above (the bubble),

52
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,700
to pinch both ends (of the bubble, against each other),

53
00:03:15,689 --> 00:03:18,309
to pull (the bubble), and twist it around.

54
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,260
And you can see you have a little "bean", the pinch-wist...

55
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:28,940
wedging the head of the frog...

56
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:33,060
horizontally against the rest of its body.

57
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,060
Well this frog is almost finished,

58
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,840
you can even see we don't have much air left. 

59
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,039
We're going to make two little front legs,

60
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:44,479
it's very important that these legs shouldn't be too big,

61
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,840
we'll twist them at the base of the pinch-twist,

62
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,080
and will come and sit there quite naturally.

63
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,000
Very good! The stomach of the frog will be located...

64
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:59,920
a bit further than its legs.

65
00:04:00,119 --> 00:04:03,379
Then, you cut... so to speak... 

66
00:04:03,589 --> 00:04:07,909
you fold... the balloon, at almost half way (of the remaining length).

67
00:04:08,419 --> 00:04:14,039
The end needs to be a little bit longer,

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,940
(so we can make one last bubble).

69
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:24,520
So, the little stomach... one hind leg... two hind legs...

70
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,520
and a little tail... that you attach like this.

71
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,680
Then all you'll need is to wedge the frog's front legs

72
00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:34,760
into its back legs!

73
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:38,420
And here's our little frog!

74
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:42,200
As we've grown accustomed to doing,

75
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,160
I'll make the frog again at my usual speed.

76
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:53,649
Practise... try to go  as fast as me,

77
00:04:54,860 --> 00:05:01,880
when you can do that... you'll be a professional ballooner!

78
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,360
The day you can do this... 

79
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:10,060
you'll have reached the stage where you could be a professional ballooner!

80
00:05:29,229 --> 00:05:32,989
The finishing touches...

81
00:05:35,849 --> 00:05:40,189
And here... we can really say... that a little touch of marker...

82
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:42,780
brings a balloon sculpture to life!

83
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,360
What have we learned thanks to our little frogs?

84
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,550
Well in fact... we haven't learned anything!

85
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,900
Really! All the techniques used to make the frog...

86
00:05:54,110 --> 00:06:00,190
we've learned while making the little dog... and the air sword.

87
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,580
But we've still... used an important concept,

88
00:06:05,939 --> 00:06:07,219
What is it?

89
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,860
Practice... practice!

90
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:13,540
To be a very good ballooner, you need to practise...

91
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,960
you need to train, you need to make a balloon... two balloons... a hundred balloons!

92
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,980
So practise! You can now make a little dog...

93
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,720
you can make a sword... you can make a frog...

94
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,580
next time, I'll teach you how to make a little tiger,

95
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,620
which doesn't take any particular trick to make,

96
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,020
other than the ones I've already taught you... which are:

97
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,480
the little sausage... the little bubble... the Pinch-Twist...

98
00:06:40,749 --> 00:06:43,849
the air pressure control... and the attention to details!

99
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:45,910
So... See you soon... 

100
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,360
for another lesson... with Môssieur Ballon!
