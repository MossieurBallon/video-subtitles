Hi!

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:11,000
How do you make angles with balloons?

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,080
First, take the part of the balloon where you want to form the angle, and secure it between your hands...

4
00:00:18,579 --> 00:00:22,639
so that the balloon will be folded between your palms.

5
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:24,079
Then...

6
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,799
you press until the folded part of the balloon disappears between your two palms.

7
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,500
Sometimes you can even hear a little "pop" sound.

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,460
You then, very gently, let the fold out from between the palm of your hands by opening them slightly.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,000
Then, you gently ease back on the rest of the balloon, and there you have it!

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,500
That's generally enough to make an angle.

11
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Now, if you want to refine your angle to make it even pointier...

12
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:55,000
You take the balloon in one hand, with the folded angle showing between your thumb and forefinger.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,500
You pinch the angle with the other hand until there's almost no more air in it...

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
just a bit of latex between your fingers.

15
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,000
You then rotate that bit of latex, held tightly between your fingers.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,000
Then release it gently, so that air gradually comes back in.

17
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,000
And then, ease back on the rest of the balloon.

18
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,500
Voila!

19
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,700
As always, practice on your own...

20
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,500
before going on to another lesson with MÃ´ssier Ballon.
