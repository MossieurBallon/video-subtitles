00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:05,940
Hello! 

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,940
Today, Môssieur Ballon will teach you...

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,000
to make... a sword!

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:11,320
A sword? What am I saying...

5
00:00:11,569 --> 00:00:13,229
This isn't a mere sword!

6
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:16,420
It's an air-saber...

7
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,830
equipped with a digital protection and a push button!

8
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:21,460
You'll see, Môssieur Ballon never lies!

9
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:22,460
Although he tends to exaggerate a little.

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,420
So, for this famed air-saber,

11
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,140
I've chosen... a silver balloon.

12
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:33,539
I find that the colour of silver balloons...

13
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:38,740
matches... the steel of a real sword really well.

14
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,510
For the saber, you need to inflate the balloon all the way to the end,

15
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:47,860
On the other hand, the air pressure shouldn't be too tight.

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,340
There... I let some air escape a little...

17
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,760
There... can you see how it's fairly supple?

18
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,700
Now... you can tie your knot.

19
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,160
So, you can see I do this a lot with the balloon,

20
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:06,500
but you may or may not be able to do it.

21
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,300
I have dry hands, and this allows me...

22
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,340
to make the balloon thinner (like this).

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:14,200
If you have hands that are a little moist,

24
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,320
your palm will grip on the balloon and make it burst.

25
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,240
If that's the case don't do this!

26
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,210
So, here's a balloon inflated all the way.

27
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,840
Did someone say a sword?

28
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:27,600
Well... it's not quite finished yet.

29
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:31,540
I'll start with making a little bubble.

30
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:34,800
So, as for the 'sausage', I'd like to remind you...

31
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:38,110
all you need is to press at the length you want, 

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,860
and twist the balloon !

33
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:41,730
An important detail...

34
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,060
always twist the balloon in the same direction!

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:47,620
You can't twist it towards the left one time, and towards the right the next time

36
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:49,920
You need to choose! Always left or always right!

37
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,780
In the same way...

38
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,060
I personally always twist it the same way,

39
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,840
and I always make the balloons pass on my left side.

40
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,660
So if you're left-handed...

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:03,140
you may want to do it in the opposite direction.

42
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,200
So, a little bubble...

43
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,480
I press a little...

44
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,540
and next, we'll make a loop.

45
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,940
So this loop shouldn't be too big... nor too small.

46
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,020
It'll have to be just the right size.

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:21,079
What size should it be?

48
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,419
Well it's simple,

49
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:25,660
The loop will have to be big enough...

50
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,300
for the balloon to fit through it.

51
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,020
So... here...

52
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,659
I went with this size.

53
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:40,599
Once you've settled on... the size of your loop,

54
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,680
you press and twist......

55
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,560
a bit like the dog's ears,

56
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,260
except it's a whole loop.

57
00:02:47,589 --> 00:02:52,149
So this... is what our balloon sculpture looks like for now.

58
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,700
Then all that is needed is to pass the balloon...

59
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:58,080
through the loop.

60
00:02:59,399 --> 00:03:00,399
There!

61
00:03:00,399 --> 00:03:03,399
And you have something which is starting...

62
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:04,739
to look...

63
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:06,010
starting!!!

64
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:07,430
to look!!!

65
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:09,059
like a sword!

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,600
And this is where the difference is made...

67
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:17,260
between a beginner who will leave their sword like this...

68
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,760
and someone who's an artist, who will be able to...

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,860
give a far more professional shape to this balloon.

70
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,820
First, I'll press...

71
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,240
and stick the balloon between my palms like this.

72
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:42,160
Look, I've given it a little shape that's nice and straight

73
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,680
and lengthened. Next...

74
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,360
I'll give this a shape that's rather straight,

75
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:57,260
and slightly curved backwards, like the blade of a saber!

76
00:03:57,869 --> 00:03:59,869
And finally...

77
00:03:59,869 --> 00:04:01,399
I find this knot a little awkward...

78
00:04:01,399 --> 00:04:07,579
I'm goig to teach you to make what's called a "pinch-twist".

79
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,900
You can call it however you want, what matters...

80
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:14,440
is that... how can I show you...

81
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:21,480
with one hand...  one finger... two fingers...

82
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:28,560
you hold the balloon knot. And... with your finger...

83
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:32,820
you slip your left forefinger underneath it...

84
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:38,000
And... turn this way...

85
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,920
and take out your finger... and turn it well.

86
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,320
Here's the finished sword!

87
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:53,649
You can see that by making a little extra effort, 

88
00:04:54,349 --> 00:04:56,789
this sword really looks like... a sword!

89
00:04:56,789 --> 00:05:01,129
I told you a saber... an air saber...

90
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,560
with a digital protection!

91
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,220
in the sense that it protects your fingers ["digit" in latin].

92
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,080
And the pushbutton... if the force is with you and you press it,

93
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:11,860
the blade should go back in!

94
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,160
But... you need to have the force with you!

95
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:19,520
You can see that with little effort...

96
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,000
we get to a product...

97
00:05:22,009 --> 00:05:23,849
that really looks like a sword.

98
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:30,720
And here is... the same sword... without the finishing touch!

99
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:35,189
So I'd like to encourage you... my dear students...

100
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,260
To give an extra touch to your work!

101
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,120
This will tell the difference between an artist, a pro,

102
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,599
or an amateur and a beginner!

103
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,780
Look at these two swords that don't look alike...

104
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:55,360
All it takes... is to add a slight curve in one place,

105
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:01,840
to pinch the little bubble like this,

106
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:07,800
and you can see...

107
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:14,580
we have two swords that are really...

108
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,560
let's just say they're swords!

109
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,760
Ok! Shall we?

110
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,140
So, as always, I will now...

111
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:26,780
make... the sword at normal speed,

112
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,070
like I would during an event,

113
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,979
and you'll practise going as fast as me!

114
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:40,900
Frankly, the sword is one of the simpler balloon sculptures!

115
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,080
Which is convenient, because if you're at a birthday party...

116
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:46,280
and you make swords, everyone will want one!

117
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:50,040
So you shouldn't take too much time to make them...

118
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,220
15 seconds, 20 seconds maximum

119
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,180
and here's... our little sword!

120
00:06:55,629 --> 00:06:56,860
What have we learned?

121
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:00,320
Well, we've learned... several things

122
00:07:01,619 --> 00:07:06,359
But the main thing was the "pinch-twist"

123
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:09,539
which we could otherwise...

124
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,620
just call a little "bean"...

125
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,939
So we'll get back to the little "bean" later,

126
00:07:17,939 --> 00:07:22,299
because it's a very important part of the little tiger,

127
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,060
which I'll teach you to make in a following lesson.

128
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,980
So, we've learned to make a "bean", we've learned...

129
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,800
or rather we had already learned it with the little doggy,

130
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,960
but... we've revised that it was important...

131
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,160
to give the balloon shape, simply...

132
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,740
by directing it with your fingers... practise like this!

133
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,280
You can see here... we have a shape...

134
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,480
the shape of a saber going off this way.

135
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,280
a saber doesn't go this way, it wouldn't be a saber!

136
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,120
And... it's very important... and in every one of my lessons...

137
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,820
I'd like to, if I may, remind you...

138
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:01,749
of this important point...

139
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:04,529
Go the extra mile, give your creation an extra touch!

140
00:08:04,529 --> 00:08:05,909
Don't do things half way!

141
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,500
Everyone can make a little dog...

142
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,980
everyone can make a sword...

143
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,880
But not everyone can make...

144
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,200
a sword... Môssieur Ballon's style!

145
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,060
(except my students!)
