00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,720
Hello, and welcome to Môssieur Ballon's website!

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,700
A promise made is a promise kept!

3
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:12,520
Today, I'll teach you...

4
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:15,549
how to make... a little tiger!

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,400
As usual, we'll start...

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,260
by, simply, inflating a balloon...

7
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,699
while leaving, maybe this time, for a start...

8
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:29,100
a little more... a little more... than a hand's width.

9
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,060
So, here... is our basic balloon.

10
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,420
We're going to start by making... one bubble...

11
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,900
two bubbles... three bubbles... four bubbles...

12
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:52,260
and... five bubbles!

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:58,220
which we'll attach... at their base,

14
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:03,460
like we did with the frog, which started out with four bubbles.

15
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,420
Next, once these five bubbles are done (and attached), 

16
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:16,280
we'll continue with a sixth bubble, at the base of the first five bubbles,

17
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,420
immediately followed by a very small sausage.

18
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:24,490
Ok, let's say, a sausage that's about two bubbles wide.

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,640
Once you've finished the little bubble and the sausage,

20
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:32,900
I'm passing two fingers through my loop of bubbles, 

21
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,040
and...forcing them...

22
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,720
past the sausage like this.

23
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:40,800
Take the time to watch.

24
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:45,980
Next we have to make that "bean" we talked about.

25
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,760
You can see... 

26
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,340
to make things clearer

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:59,280
you can see... here is our tiger's muzzle

28
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,900
and... its two little eyes!

29
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:07,400
So we're going to pull its ears into a "bean" shape.

30
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,220
As usual, we hook our fingers underneath...

31
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,740
pull... and there!

32
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,180
Well now it's quite simple, we're going to make our tiger two front legs...

33
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,160
two hind legs... like the little dog, there won't be...

34
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:29,340
any difference, you can see the basic parts are the same,

35
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:32,780
it's just the head that changes, and the drawing, of course...

36
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,460
we musn't forget the tiger's stripes!

37
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,620
One little bubble... for the neck,

38
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,820
two big sausages... for the front legs,

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,540
a little sausage... for the stomach,

40
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:49,319
two big sausages, ... of the same length...

41
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,740
as the front legs... for the hind legs,

42
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,440
which leaves us with the tail... as usual...

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,800
we'll give it a little shape...

44
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,120
and we will now go on to drawing the tiger's features.

45
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:08,479
So the tiger never goes anywhere without its stripy pyjamas,

46
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,160
All we need to do...

47
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,400
is stripes... and its whiskers...

48
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:36,100
I am now going to carry out the tiger at my usual speed,

49
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,580
try and train... being as fast as me, if not faster!

50
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,759
So fiddling, always fiddling. If you can...

51
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:55,599
if you have a good quality felt-tip pen,

52
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,419
when you draw on the balloon, try to shape your stripes like long triangles,

53
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:05,079
with the pen stroke thicker at the start than at the finish,

54
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:11,100
which will give us...

55
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:14,090
a more interesting design,

56
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:20,940
than just streaks and lines...

57
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:26,979
And there... here's the little tiger!

58
00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:28,900
So, that's all for this video...

59
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,060
practise well... and 

60
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:34,160
see you soon, for a new lesson...

61
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,720
with Môssieur Ballon!
