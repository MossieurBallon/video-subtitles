00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,830
Hello!

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:11,680
Today, I'm going to teach you how to make an adorable little fish.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,620
You'll need two balloons.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,860
I've chosen an orange modeling balloon to make the body of the fish,

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,160
but you could use red, or any other color you like,

6
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,700
and a little white round balloon to make the eyes!

7
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,960
To start, we're going to inflate...

8
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:36,560
the modeling balloon...

9
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,280
but not all the way!

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:41,300
We're going to leave... about...

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:44,420
a hand's width, which will not be inflated...

12
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,200
roughly like this.

13
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,300
We're going to start by making...

14
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,900
one sausage bubble...

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,060
about three fingers wide.

16
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:02,520
Followed by another sausage bubble,

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,040
a bit smaller this time,

18
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:06,300
about two fingers.

19
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:08,560
then another sausage bubble, exactly......

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,020
the third sausage bubble will have to be exactly...

21
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:13,160
the same size as the second bubble.

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:16,720
and the fourth one...

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,960
will be the same size as the first one.

24
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:26,260
So, big sausage bubble, small sausage bubble, small sausage bubble, and big sausage bubble.

25
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,840
Remember, when you have a row of bubbles, you only need to hold the first and the last one,

26
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,200
and the ones in the middle will not unravel.

27
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,460
No need to contort yourself every which way!

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,740
You take...

29
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,200
the... knot...

30
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
and wrap it around several times...

31
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,740
around the base of the fourth bubble.

32
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,740
Turn them together, several times, to secure the knot properly.

33
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,240
Compress the balloon to keep it nice and supple.

34
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,680
And here, we take the size... let's see... the whole of a hand...

35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,880
about an entire hand's width.

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:09,540
Make a small regular bubble, and turn it into a "pinch-twist",

37
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,760
followed by another little round one,

38
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:17,960
so a little, round, regular bubble,

39
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,260
that we will also turn into a pinch-twist

40
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:27,640
Spread out...

41
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,940
the air pressure over the rest of the balloon.

42
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:39,440
And create another sausage bubble, the same size as this one.

43
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,700
Here, these two bubbles should be the same size.

44
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:45,820
Then a third one, still the same size,

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,800
and attach it to the two others.

46
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,340
Next... with what's left,

47
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:56,660
we're going to puncture the end of the balloon,

48
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,140
let the air out, just a little,

49
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,440
and tie a knot.

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,260
There!

51
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,580
Divide the rest of the bubble into two parts of unequal lengths,

52
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:15,580
the first one will be a bit longer...

53
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,800
and the last one, a bit shorter.

54
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,920
Then, tie the last bubble around...

55
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:31,299
the four bubbles.

56
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,300
Those will form the tail.

57
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,280
And the little bit that's left, you're going to tuck it...

58
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:41,060
between the three large bubbles.

59
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:48,200
For the tail, we're going to fold it all together.

60
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:49,829
The little bubbles...

61
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:52,820
I mean, the crease between the small bubbles joins up with the crease between the big bubbles,

62
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,100
and then you can twist them together, like this!

63
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,960
There!

64
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:10,240
Now, we're going to set aside the body of the fish,

65
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,120
and take the little white round balloon,

66
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,780
which we'll inflate... but not too much!

67
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:23,880
Here, when you look at the balloon...

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:27,260
See... it has to be proportioned roughly like this.

69
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,820
Yes... a bit smaller than the tail.

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,300
Tie your knot... you can in fact make it a double knot!

71
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:36,300
And... you're going to divide it...

72
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,000
just like making a bubble with a modeling balloon...

73
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:42,680
you're going to divide the round balloon into two equal parts...

74
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:54,860
that you're going to tuck...

75
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:58,040
tuck right here,

76
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:02,760
and this little bit of balloon is going to come and... close up...

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,320
the gap between these two eyes.

78
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,800
And here's our little fish!

79
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:16,980
If you like, you can rearrange the lips,

80
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,780
so you can really see the crease, it looks a little cuter.

81
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,380
And now we're going to take a marker,

82
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,380
and draw eyes on it!

83
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,320
Like this!

84
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:51,820
Now, if you like...

85
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,580
we can add more bubbles.

86
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,780
This is extra, it's optional...

87
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,880
a transparent modeling balloon...

88
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,580
that we're going to inflate just halfway.

89
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:10,860
With this, make a row of bubbles, separated...

90
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,860
by a pinch-twist.

91
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,900
So : a bubble... a pinch-twist...

92
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,940
a bubble... a pinch-twist...

93
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:22,620
Don't forget to regularly compress the balloon,

94
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:30,280
to evenly spread out the air pressure, towards the tip of the balloon.

95
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:53,000
a bubble... a pinch-twist... (and so on)

96
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,460
And when you're left with one little oval, simply divide it into two bubbles...

97
00:06:57,820 --> 00:07:01,540
that we're going to block together...

98
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,440
that we're going to tie... onto a pinch-twist,

99
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:08,600
to get something that looks like this.

100
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,240
Next we take our little fish...

101
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,280
and we're going to tuck this...

102
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,420
behind the eyes...

103
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:25,460
tuck the first bubble behind the eyes,

104
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:28,780
and the knot, we're going to stretch it...

105
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,860
and attach it all the way to... the lips...

106
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:33,280
and hide the nozzle.

107
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:39,040
There, our adorable little fish is finished!

108
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:39,900
So...

109
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:43,720
See you soon! For another lesson... with MÃ´ssieur Ballon !
